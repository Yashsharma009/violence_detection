1. Introduction:
Violence detection in videos has various applications, including security surveillance, content moderation, and media analysis. This project provides a solution to automatically identify violent activities in video footage.

2. Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- imgaug
- tqdm

3. Dataset:
The dataset used for training the violence detection model is the Real Life Violence Situations Dataset, which can be found on Kaggle. You need to download and preprocess this dataset before training the model.

4. Usage:
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies mentioned in the requirements section.
- Download the Real Life Violence Situations Dataset from Kaggle and preprocess it using the provided Python script.
- Train the violence detection model using the preprocessed dataset.
- Use the trained model to predict violence in new videos.

5. Results:
The trained model achieves ![image](https://github.com/Yashsharma009/violence_detection/assets/116294789/ab98928f-3a17-4a51-bf21-343bf028ccf3).
 on the test dataset. Sample results and visualizations can be found in the 'output' folder.
